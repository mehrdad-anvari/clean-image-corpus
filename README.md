## 🚀 Demo

Try the tool here:  
[**Annotation Tool Demo**](https://mehrdad-anvari.github.io/clean-image-corpus/)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Please open the demo in **Google Chrome**.  
> The tool uses the **File System Access API**, which is only fully supported in Chromium-based browsers.

## 📁 Project Folder Structure

To use the tool, organize your project directory as follows:

```
Project-folder/
└── images/
    ├── image_file_1
    ├── image_file_2
    ├── ...
    └── image_file_n
```

Put all your image files inside the `images` folder. The tool will read and annotate images from this directory.
